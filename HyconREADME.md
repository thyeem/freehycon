# HYCON (HYC) - Powering hyperconnected blockchain solutions

Welcome to the HYCON source code repository! Our goal at HYCON is to enable a faster and more scalable blockchain for many different use cases.

We have a lot of exciting developments coming up, and we'll have our timeline added to [Issues](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/hycon-core/issues) in the near future.

### Getting Releases

We aim to create a release at least once a month with improvements to node and the network. You can find our latest releases in the [Releases](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/hycon-core/releases) section.

Downloading and unzipping the archived file will allow you to run the full node and mine on your system. For more information, check out the Wiki article [here](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/hycon-core/wiki/Mining-Instructions). We currently support Linux, MacOS X, and Windows operating systems.

### Mining

HYCON currently uses the ASIC-resistant `cryptonight-v7` proof-of-work algorithm. We have made some adjustments to [xmrig](https://github.com/xmrig) to ensure that the GPU miner runs smoothly with the HYCON node. For your ease of use, binary releases have been created for each variant.

Please check out the repository that is relevant to your system to begin mining: 

- [AMD](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/xmrig-amd)
- [CPU](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/xmrig)
- [Nvidia](https://github.com/Team-Hycon/xmrig-nvidia)
